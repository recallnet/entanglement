# entanglement
Alpha Entanglement: Rust Library for Distributed Storage. Implements alpha entanglement codes for robust error correction and data availability in distributed systems. Features an abstract storage interface for flexible protocol integration (e.g., IROH, IPFS). Optimized for fault tolerance and efficient data recovery in decentralized environments.
